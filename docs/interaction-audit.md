# Interaction audit

Tracks how each interactive dross command conforms to the **propose-and-react,
one-decision-per-turn** contract (`dross-interaction-contract` builtin rule +
`assets/prompts/_interaction.md` playbook).

**Scope.** "Interactive" = any command whose `assets/commands/dross-<name>.md`
wrapper lists `AskUserQuestion` in `allowed-tools`. Non-interactive command-backed
prompts are **out of scope** and must be enrolled explicitly in the [`## Exempt`](#exempt)
list below — each with a reason — rather than silently omitted. The Go test in
`internal/cmd/interaction_audit_test.go` fails if an interactive command has no
section here, and `internal/cmd/interaction_coverage_test.go` fails (fail-closed)
if any command-backed prompt is neither sectioned nor exempt.

**Conformance legend** (filled in by phases 11–13):

- ✅ conforms — one decision per turn, proposes a default, references the playbook via `dross interaction show`
- 🟡 partial — drives conversationally but doesn't yet invoke the `dross interaction show` emitter
- ⬜ pending — not yet audited
- ❌ violates — batches decisions or dumps an artifact/agenda wall

Each command lists its **decision points** (the moments it asks the user to
choose) one row each — not one row per command — so the retrofit can confirm the
pattern point by point.

## Exempt

Command-backed prompts that are intentionally **non-interactive** — they carry no
section above. This list is machine-read by `interaction_coverage_test.go` and the
`dross doctor` coverage lint: a non-interactive command must appear here (with a
reason) or the build fails. Removing an entry fails the build unless that command
becomes interactive (gains an `AskUserQuestion` shim + a section above).

| Command | Reason |
|---|---|
| status | read-only — prints `dross status` and stops; no decision points |
| plan-review | subagent-only — spawns a cold reviewer and relays findings; no user turns |

## Pilot result (phase 10 — c-3)

`dross-spec` is the pilot that proved the snippet-delivery mechanism before
phases 11–13 repeat it. The pilot ran in a fresh `/dross-spec` session on
**2026-06-21**.

**Outcome: nested `@`-include FAILED; resolved via the `dross interaction show`
emitter.** Loading `/dross-spec` expands the command wrapper's top-level
`@`-include of `spec.md`, but `spec.md`'s own `@`-include of the snippet
(`@~/.claude/dross/prompts/_interaction.md`) arrives as literal text — the
two-level (wrapper → spec.md → _interaction.md) expansion does **not** resolve,
so the snippet sentinel never reaches the model through the include. Per the
locked `snippet_delivery` decision, the `dross interaction show` CLI emitter
(embeds `_interaction.md`, prints it verbatim, mirrors `dross rule show`) was
adopted and wired into `spec.md`'s pre-flight.

| Check | Result | When |
|---|---|---|
| Nested `@`-include delivers the snippet to the model | ❌ FAILED — arrives as literal text | 2026-06-21 |
| `dross interaction show` prints the playbook verbatim from the binary (`TestInteractionShowEmitsPlaybook`, single-source `TestInteractionPlaybookSingleSource`) | ✅ resolved via the `dross interaction show` emitter | 2026-06-21 |
| `spec.md` pre-flight invokes the emitter and dropped the dead `@`-include (`TestSpecPilotUsesEmitter`) | ✅ pass | 2026-06-21 |

**Pattern for phases 11–13:** each interactive prompt's pre-flight runs
`dross interaction show` (alongside `dross rule show`) — grep-verifiable, no
dependency on nested include expansion.

## Core loop (phase 11 — retrofit-core-loop)

The spec→plan→execute→verify→ship pipeline plus the PR-review panel. `dross-spec`
is the phase-10 pilot; `dross-plan/execute/verify/ship/review` are retrofitted in
phase 11. (`dross-milestone` and `dross-quick` are scoping/one-off commands —
retrofitted under Setup & config in phase 12.)

### dross-spec

### dross-init

| Decision point | Current pattern | Conforms | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Identity walk | one field per turn (name → … → non-goals) | ✅ | per-field, not one bundled questionnaire; confirmed by one-line summary |

| Runtime mode | options | ✅ | own turn |
| Rules import | accept/edit | ✅ | own turn |

### dross-onboard

| Severity | proposal turn (hard / soft) | ✅ | separate proposal turn |
| Wording | proposal turn (accept / reword) | ✅ | confirmed by one-line summary, never a rules-block dump |

### dross-inbox

| Decision point | Current pattern | Conforms | Notes |

## Other interactive commands (audited in phase 13)

The read-only-leaning commands one tier out from the loop: the two heavy audits
(`secure`/`quality`), the backfill engine (`architecture`), and the handoff pair
(`pause`/`resume`). Each has essentially **one gated decision**, so the retrofit is
uniform — wire `dross interaction show` into the pre-flight (per the
`scan_command_emitter` and `handoff_emitter_exception` decisions) and confirm the
single propose-and-react turn. Two carry a deliberate artifact-preview exception
(the drafted doc / handoff *is* the thing being confirmed, like `ship`'s PR-body
preview).

### dross-architecture

| Decision point | Current pattern | Conforms | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| ARCHITECTURE.md write approval | §3 propose→approve→write, leads with the drafted doc, single proceed/steer gate | ✅ | pre-flight runs `dross interaction show`; read-only fan-out maps features, the write is the only gated turn. Showing the full drafted doc is a deliberate artifact-preview exception (the deliverable), like ship's PR-body preview |

### dross-secure

| Decision point | Current pattern | Conforms | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Remediation-phase scaffold | §7 propose-then-ask — show criteria, confirm before locking, exactly like /dross-spec | ✅ | pre-flight runs `dross interaction show`; the emitter shapes only this gated turn — audit scope stays context-free |

### dross-quality

| Decision point | Current pattern | Conforms | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Remediation-phase scaffold | §7 propose-then-ask — show criteria, confirm before locking, exactly like /dross-spec | ✅ | pre-flight runs `dross interaction show`; the emitter shapes only this gated turn — tool sweep stays code-only, calibrate-only context |

### dross-pause

| Decision point | Current pattern | Conforms | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Confirm + amend handoff | §2 single AskUserQuestion (save / amend / cancel) | ✅ | pre-flight runs `dross interaction show`. Inline handoff-draft preview is a documented exception — the user confirms their own working memory, like ship's PR-body preview, not an artifact-dump violation |

### dross-resume

| Decision point | Current pattern | Conforms | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Prune handoff items | §2 walks each ## Next / ## Open-loops item one at a time (done / keep / edit) | ✅ | pre-flight runs `dross interaction show`; "pruning is the user's call, item by item" — never a batched dump |
