// Lifecycle state distinctness, per provider.
//
// c-3 asks for a UAT state "distinct from in-progress and from shipped": a
// phase awaiting a verdict is neither being worked nor delivered, and
// collapsing it into either is exactly what makes a board stop reflecting where
// work actually is. c-2 makes the same shape of claim one level down — picking
// a task and committing it must land in different columns.
//
// Nothing was asserting the distinctness itself. YouTrack's "UAT" is pinned by
// the bundle test only because that value has to be CREATED; Jira's
// defaultJiraStateMap["uat"] was keyed but its value unread, so collapsing it
// into "In Progress" would have satisfied every existing test while quietly
// deleting the state c-3 is about.
//
// What is asserted here is the RELATIONSHIP, not either provider's strings. A
// project is free to rename its columns — that is what [board].state_map is for
// — and a guard written against "UAT" or "In Review" would fight that. A guard
// written against "these two statuses must not be the same column" holds
// whatever the columns are called.

// distinctPairs are the lifecycle statuses that must never share a board
// column, each with the reason a reader needs when it fails.
