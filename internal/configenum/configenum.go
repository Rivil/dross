// that no longer matched its arms. Both sides now resolve through the Sets
// below, and internal/cmd/enum_divergence_test.go fails the build when a
// dispatch switch and its Set diverge.
//
// This is a leaf package: it imports nothing from internal/, so validators,
// dispatchers and the schema can all depend on it without a cycle.

//
// It is the producer side and the map side of one vocabulary, which is exactly
// where they drifted: issue.go emitted "planning" while both maps keyed
// "planned", so a phase whose plan was locked but unstarted warned and skipped
// its transition. internal/cmd/board_lifecycle_divergence_test.go now fails the
// build when either side leaves the other behind.

// request to derive one — syncPhase already derives from the plan when
// --status is absent.
// "verifying" was retired by board-task-mirror: "uat" replaced it at its only
// emitting call site, and a member nothing emits is a state-map key nothing
// will ever reach — the precise thing the divergence guard forbids. A repo
// whose [board].state_map still overrides "verifying" gets a stale-key issue
// from `dross doctor`, which is the surface that exists for exactly this.
//
// The last three are TASK- and verdict-level states (board-task-mirror). They
// extend this same set rather than starting a second vocabulary: there is one
// override point ([board].state_map) and one build-failing divergence guard,
// and a second mechanism would let the two drift — which is the exact bug this
// set was introduced to close.
// "task-complete" is the TASK lane's terminal state, and it is separate from
// "complete" on purpose: the two lanes each carry their own `dross/status:`

// label onto every task card and make task_lifecycle.go's board->plan reading
