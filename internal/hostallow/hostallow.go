// Package hostallow decides which hosts dross may attach a secret to.
//
// The problem it solves: `[remote].api_base` and `[board].base_url` are
// committed config, so the repo you cloned chooses them. Every authenticated
// request dross makes reads its token from the env var named by
// `[remote].auth_env` and sends it to whatever those keys point at. A repo that
// sets `api_base = "https://attacker.example"` therefore exfiltrates the
// user's forge token on the next `dross ship`, with no prompt and nothing
// unusual on screen.
//
// The allowlist is DERIVED, never configured. A `[remote].allowed_hosts` key
// would be self-authorizing — a hostile `.dross/` would simply set that too, and
// the check would gate config on config. So the allowed set is:
//
//	the authority of [remote].url   (the repo's own host: self-hosted forges
//	                                 share it between remote and api_base)
//	+ built-in known-SaaS hosts     (covers the github.com/api.github.com and
//	                                 gitlab.com/atlassian.net/youtrack splits)
//	+ Extra                         (machine-local, from the gitignored
//	                                 .dross/local.toml — see the locked
//	                                 escape_hatch decision)
//
// Extra is the only user-widened input and it cannot be cloned, which is what
// keeps the guarantee from being self-authorizing while a genuinely odd
// self-hosted install still has a door.
//
// Two properties are load-bearing and easy to lose in a refactor:
//
//   - There is no allow-all. A zero Policy resolves to the SaaS defaults, so a
//     caller that forgets to populate the field fails CLOSED. Every "unknown
//     means allow" default in a security check is eventually reached by the
//     code path nobody remembered to wire.
//   - Every refusal wraps ErrRefused. Callers must be able to tell a policy
//     refusal from a transient network error, because dross degrades gracefully
//     on the latter (mergeGate falls back to git ancestry) and must NOT degrade
//     on the former — silently downgrading under attack is the failure mode the
//     locked refusal_behaviour decision exists to prevent.
