// This file is c-4: no settable project.toml key is inert.
//
// A key that `dross project set` accepts, `dross project show` prints and
// options.md offers, but that nothing ever reads, is a lie with a UI. The user
// types a value, the tool says OK, and nothing happens — which is worse than
// the key not existing, because the absence would have been visible.
//
// The guard walks the SETTER'S OWN case list rather than a hand-typed roster,
// so a key added tomorrow is covered without anyone remembering to add it here.

// inertKeyReasons is the exemption list, and it is deliberately small and
// individually argued.
//
// Per the locked inert_key_disposition decision this is NOT a dumping ground: an
// inert key is normally resolved by giving it a reader or taking it off the
// settable surface, and a key earns a line here only with a stated reason. A
// blanket "known inert" list would turn this whole file into a formality — the
// next inert key gets appended and the test keeps passing, which is exactly the
// failure that produced this phase.
//
// Shrinking this map is the point. Every entry is a debt with a name.
