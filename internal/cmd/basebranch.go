//     safe to make nor to skip silently
//   - unprotected, or any other forge: today's policy, below
//
// Today's policy: a base also behind origin is left to the ff-only / --recover
// machinery downstream; .dross-only commits are pushed with
// `git push origin <base>`; a code commit ahead is refused, since unpushed code
// on the base is a real divergence the user must reconcile.
