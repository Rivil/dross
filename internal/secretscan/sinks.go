// Mirrors internal/toolfence and internal/pathfence deliberately: registry
// plus residual, judged in both directions by a walker in internal/cmd. A
// function that calls an outbound primitive (http.NewRequest*, http.Post,
// http.Get, (*http.Client).Do, exec.Command, or a registered seam) with no
// entry here is an undeclared transport; an entry naming a function that no
// longer exists is a stale declaration. The walker lives in internal/cmd for
// the same reason the other two do — it must parse the transport packages,
// which import this one.
//
// THE SCOPE IS OUTBOUND PUBLISH TRANSPORTS: the bodies dross composes and
// sends to a forge or board. Reads are declared too — as ReadOnly — so that a
// GET helper that grows a body is caught by the arm that checks its method
// literal, rather than by nobody.

// Dispositions. Exactly one is non-nil on a well-formed entry.
