# Dross

A leaner successor to [GSD](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done) for working with Claude Code on real projects.

> **Status:** v0.1.x — full plan → execute → verify loop is wired. Mutation testing covers TS/JS/Svelte (Stryker) and Go (Gremlins). Tree-sitter codex and C# (Stryker.NET) are still stubs. First real-project onboarding done; expect ongoing prompt fixes as more flows are exercised.

> Scope: Dross is built for my workflow. It's public because there's no reason not to be, but I'm not marketing it and I'm not trying to grow it into a general-purpose tool. The roadmap is a flat list because my todo list is — if Dross ever picks up users, I'll think about structure (semver, milestones, contribution guidelines) then.

> Contributing: I'm unlikely to accept feature PRs that don't match how I personally use this. Bug fixes and small quality-of-life improvements are welcome; new features probably aren't, unless we've talked first. If Dross is almost what you want but not quite, fork it — that's what AGPL is for, and you'll move faster owning your own copy than waiting on me.

## Why

GSD is genuinely good at imposing planning discipline, but at a cost: ~3 MB of prompt material loaded across 65 skills, 33 subagents, and 76 workflows. A single `/gsd-plan-phase` invocation reads ~3,000 lines of instructions before doing anything. Subagent spawns multiply that.

Dross is a rebuild around three pivots:

1. **Lean prompts.** Target ≤300 lines per slash command. Most state lives in machine-parseable TOML, not prose Markdown.
2. **Pair-mode execute by default.** Code is authored *with* you, not delivered *to* you. Subagent spawns kept to genuinely independent work (parallel mutation runs, multi-language audits).
3. **Test efficacy as a first-class gate.** GSD checks that tests *exist*. Dross checks that tests *catch breakage* — via mutation testing (Stryker / Gremlins), coverage delta, and an LLM judge mapping each acceptance criterion to a specific test.

## The name

Dross is the AI sidekick from Will Wight's [Cradle](https://www.willwight.com/cradle) series — a Presence that lives in the protagonist's head, compiling battle plans, predicting opponents, crafting illusions, and handling "unimportant thoughts" to free up his bandwidth. Sarcastic, dramatic, fond of his person.

## Footprint vs GSD

Measured by recursively resolving `@`-imports for each command and summing bytes. Token estimate is `bytes ÷ 4`, the standard heuristic for English+markdown — accurate to ±15% vs an exact tokenizer.

**Per-command boot** (what loads before the model writes a single response):

| Command | Bytes | Est. tokens |
|---|---:|---:|
| GSD `/gsd-execute-phase` | 185,972 | ~46,500 |
| GSD `/gsd-plan-phase` | 103,413 | ~25,900 |
| GSD `/gsd-new-project` | 69,637 | ~17,400 |
| GSD `/gsd-progress` | 37,864 | ~9,500 |
| Dross `/dross-init` | 7,169 | **~1,790** |
| Dross `/dross-onboard` | 5,147 | **~1,290** |
| Dross `/dross-options` | 5,988 | **~1,500** |
| Dross `/dross-milestone` | 6,034 | **~1,510** |
| Dross `/dross-ship` | 5,786 | **~1,450** |
| Dross `/dross-rule` | 1,936 | **~480** |
| Dross `/dross-spec` | 5,439 | **~1,360** |
| Dross `/dross-plan` | 5,495 | **~1,370** |
| Dross `/dross-plan-review` | 5,264 | **~1,320** |
| Dross `/dross-execute` | 7,391 | **~1,850** |
| Dross `/dross-verify` | 8,456 | **~2,110** |
| Dross `/dross-status` | 1,439 | **~360** |

**Total prompt-surface** (everything that could ever load):

| | Bytes | Est. tokens |
|---|---:|---:|
| GSD (workflows + references + skills + agents) | 2,494,659 | ~624,000 |
| Dross (commands + prompts) | 68,603 | ~17,150 |
| **Ratio** | | **≈ 36×** |

**Being honest about these numbers:**

- **Dross is still incomplete.** The codex tree-sitter indexer is a stub; Stryker (TS/JS/Svelte) and Gremlins (Go) are wired — C# (Stryker.NET), GDScript, HTML/CSS visual diffs are still designed-only. `/dross-verify` landed at ~1,890 tokens — ~24× cheaper than GSD's 46,500 — though that's slash-command boot only; the verify loop reads project test files at runtime, which adds variable cost.
- **Per-invocation isn't the runtime cost.** GSD spawns subagents (planner, plan-checker, executor, verifier). Each loads its own agent prompt + references in fresh context, multiplying the real per-flow cost by 2-3×. The 25.9k for `/gsd-plan-phase` is closer to ~60-80k of total prompt material per phase. Dross runs inline — no subagent multiplication.
- **Prompt caching mitigates this.** Anthropic's prompt cache amortises repeats, so steady-state cost is much lower than the load surface implies. Cold starts, branch switches, and subagent spawns break the cache; that's where the bill actually shows up.
- **The ratio is the worst-case load surface, not a runtime bill.** It's still directionally meaningful — fewer files, smaller files, fewer spawns add up — but don't expect the same multiplier in your monthly Anthropic invoice.

```

Symlinks mean edits to `assets/` in the dross repo apply immediately — no re-install on prompt tweaks.

## Install

### Prebuilt binary (recommended)

GoReleaser publishes archives for `darwin/arm64` (primary), `darwin/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, and `linux/amd64` on every `v*` tag. Grab the matching `.tar.gz` from [releases](https://github.com/Rivil/dross/releases), extract, drop the `dross` binary on your PATH, and run `dross --help`.

This installs the binary only — slash commands and prompts still need a checkout (`make install`) until those ship as a separate package.

### From source

```sh
make build       # builds ./dross for current arch (with commit + build date in `dross version`)
make test        # go test -count=1 ./...
make install     # builds + installs binary + symlinks all slash commands & prompts
make doctor      # verifies install: PATH, binary freshness, symlink targets — exits non-zero on any issue
make uninstall   # removes binary, all dross-* skills, and the prompts symlink
make release-snapshot  # local goreleaser dry-run — produces dist/, never tags or pushes
```

After `make install`, ensure `~/.local/bin` is on your PATH:

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Then in any Claude Code session, `/dross-init` (greenfield) or `/dross-onboard` (existing repo).

## Telemetry

Dross records local-only usage events at `~/.claude/dross/telemetry.jsonl`. The intent is single-developer self-observation — a dogfood log you can read back later to find where the tool gets in your way.

**What's recorded.** One JSONL event per `dross` invocation (command path, duration, exit code, error class) plus outcome events from `verify` (verdict, mutation score, file/criterion counts), `ship` (provider, result, force-flag use), and `phase create` (ordinal). All events carry a 12-character SHA-256 hash of the absolute repo path so per-project trends are visible without exposing the path itself.

**What's NOT recorded.** Anything you typed. No criterion text, no decision text, no commit messages, no PR titles or bodies, no reviewer names, no file contents, no repo URLs. Counts and small enums only.

**Privacy posture.** Local file. No network. No daemon. No third party. Default ON; `/dross-init` and `/dross-onboard` ask once and stamp `asked_at` so you're never re-prompted across projects.

**Toggles.**
```sh
dross stats opt-out       # disable; persisted in defaults.toml
dross stats opt-in        # re-enable; same file
DROSS_NO_TELEMETRY=1      # authoritative kill-switch (env var; overrides on-disk config)
dross stats path          # print the log file path
```

**Reading it back.**
```sh
dross stats               # default `show` — top commands, error buckets,
                          #   force-flag count, verify verdicts, ship results
dross stats show --since 7d
dross stats show --since 2026-05-01
```

The schema is versioned and stable; the log is append-only and rotates at 10 MB. Safe to share in conversations or pastebins for ad-hoc analysis since it carries no project-identifying content.

Dross is conceptually inspired by [GSD](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done) by TÂCHES (Lex Christopherson), distributed under the MIT License. No code or prompt text is copied; this is a clean Go reimplementation built around different design pivots (lean prompts, pair-mode execution, mutation testing as a first-class gate). If you want the full-featured, well-trodden tool, GSD is excellent — Dross is a fork of the *idea*, not the implementation.
